# W1P6-JS

Write a JavaScript program that reads two values from the user - the
first representing a month, and the second representing a day. The
program must then print the season for that month and day.
You can assume that Summer is from 21 December and ends on 20
March. Autumn is from 21 March-20 June, Winter is from 21 June-20
September, and Spring from 21 September-20 December.
